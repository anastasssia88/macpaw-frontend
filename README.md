## Personal Opinion 🙋🏼‍♀️
I'd like to thank MacPaw team for such an intereseting test task - clear instructions and beautiful design! I had a lot of fun while building it and, to be honest, a lot of frustration & struggle as I had to deliver functionality I've never built before. Which is awesome. I was able to understand concepts I couldn't grasp before.

This experience is exactly what I needed to enhance my frontend skills and to gain confidence. Whoever you decide to choose for the Intern Position, I'm very grateful to you. Thank you!
