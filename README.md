## More info ‚ÑπÔ∏è
This aplication was built using React.js, Styled Components, and is based on The Dogs API. All the basic requirements of the task are met as well as some "plus" tasks:
- the "go back" button works like in the browser
- the app has both dark and light modes and a mode switcher

## Personal Opinion üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I want to thank MacPaw team for such an intereseting test task! I had a lot of fun while building it and, to be honest, a lot of frustration & struggle as I had to deliver functionality I've never built before. Anyways, this experience is and will be very important for me as a frontend developer. Thank you!
